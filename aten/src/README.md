This directory contains the low-level tensor libraries for PyTorch,
as well as the new ATen C++ bindings.

The low-level libraries trace their lineage from the original Torch.  There are
multiple variants of the library, summarized here:

* TH = TorcH
* THC = TorcH Cuda
* THCS = TorcH Cuda Sparse (now defunct)
* THCUNN = TorcH CUda Neural Network (see cunn)
* THD = TorcH Distributed
* THNN = TorcH Neural Network
* THS = TorcH Sparse (now defunct)

(You'll also see these abbreviations show up in symbol names.)

## Reference counting

PyTorch employs reference counting in order to permit tensors to provide
differing views on a common underlying storage.  For example, when you call
view() on a Tensor, a new THTensor is allocated with differing dimensions,
but it shares the same THStorage with the original tensor.

Unfortunately, this means we are in the business of manually tracking reference
counts inside our C library code.  Fortunately, for most of our library code implementing
tensor operations, there is only one rule you have to remember:

> **Golden Rule of Reference Counting:** You must either FREE or RETURN
> a pointer which was returned by a function whose name begins with
> `new` or which you called `retain` on.
> If you return this pointer, your function name must begin with `new`.

In a long function, there may be many invocations of functions with `new` in
their name.  Your responsibility is to go through each of them and ensure
that there is a matching `free` for it for EACH exit point of the function.

### Examples

Suppose you want to get a reference to the indices of a sparse tensor.  This
function is called `newIndices`.  The `new` means you MUST free it when you're
done (usually at the end of your function.)  (It's worth noting that
`newIndices` doesn't actually allocate a fresh indices tensor; it just gives
you a pointer to the existing one.)  DO NOT directly access the member
variables of the struct.

```
THIndexTensor *indices = THSTensor_(newIndices)(state, sparse);
// ... do some stuff ...
THIndexTensor_(free)(state, indices);
```

Let's take a look at the implementation of `newIndices`.  This doesn't free the
return result of `newNarrow`, but returns it.  This justifies the `new` in its
name.

```
THIndexTensor *THSTensor_(newIndices)(const THSTensor *self) {
  // ...
  return THIndexTensor_(newNarrow)(self->indices, 1, 0, self->nnz);
}
```

Passing an object to another function does NOT absolve you of responsibility
of freeing it.  If that function holds on to a pointer to the object, it
will `retain` it itself.

```
  THLongStorage *inferred_size = THLongStorage_newInferSize(size, numel);
  THTensor_(setStorage)(self, tensor->storage, tensor->storageOffset, inferred_size, NULL);
  THLongStorage_free(inferred_size);
```

Sometimes, you have a tensor in hand which you'd like to use directly, but
under some conditions you have to have to call, e.g., `newContiguous`, to get
it into the correct form:

```
  if (!(k_->stride(3) == 1) || !(k_->stride[2] == k_->size(3))) {
    kernel = THTensor_(newContiguous)(k_);
  } else {
    THTensor_(retain)(k_);
    kernel = k_;
  }
  ...
  c10::raw::intrusive_ptr::decref(kernel);
```

In this case, we have (redundantly) called `retain` on `k_`, so that we can
unconditionally free `kernel` at the end of the function; intuitively, you
want it to be possible to replace the conditional expression with an equivalent
function call, e.g., `kernel = THTensor_(newContiguous2D)(k_)`.

### Tips

* If you have an early exit in a function (via a `return`), don't forget to
  `free` any pointers which you allocated up to this point.  If at all possible,
  move early exits prior to these allocations, so that you don't have to clean up.

* Very occasionally, you may be able to implement an algorithm more efficiently
  if you "destroy" its input.  This is a `move`; after moving an object away,
  you must NOT `free` it.  This is the one exception to the rule, and at the
  moment there is only one instance of `move` in the code base.

* We use `THError` to signal error cases, and fortunately,
  you do NOT need to make sure you've freed everything before calling `THError`,
  because by default, it aborts the entire process.  However, it's good style
  to call `THError` before performing any allocations, since in some cases we
  sketchily throw a C++ exception and try to recover (in particular, the test
  suite does this.)

## The C interface

Historically, the Torch libraries were implemented in C.  Since then, we have slowly
started rewriting bits of pieces of Torch in C++ (usually because there is some
C++ feature which would be really helpful for writing something.)  However,
Torch has *always been*, and *will always be* a library that provides a C ABI
interface, even if, at some point in the future, its internal implementation
is entirely done in a C++ library that heavily uses C++ idioms.  (At the moment,
all of the source files are C++, but they are mostly C code that happens to be
compiled as C++).

In order to achieve this, the `TH_API` macro (called `THC_API` in `THC`) plays
a crucial role: it declares a function as having C-linkage, which means that the
C++ compiler doesn't mangle its name and a C client can link against it.

As a developer, here is what you need to know:

1. If you add a function to the public API of Torch, you *must* mark it with
   `TH_API` or `THC_API` (depending if you are in CPU or CUDA land).
   This will ensure it is built with C-linkage (and on Windows, it
   will also ensure that the symbol is exported from the DLL; otherwise it
   won't be visible.)

2. C++ features should ONLY be used in `.cpp` and `.hpp` files, and not in
   `.h` files.  If you need to use a C++ type in a header file, you should
   define this in a separate, C++ only header `.hpp`, and declare it opaquely
   in the `.h`. Search for `mutex` for an example of this principle being applied.
   (This convention is OPPOSITE from the prevailing convention in PyTorch and
   ATen, where C++ headers are defined in `.h` files.)

Arguably, the "C-compatible" headers should live in a separate directory,
distinct from the C++ code.  We think this might be a good thing to do
eventually, and would make the code structure more clear, but we have not
done it at the moment.
