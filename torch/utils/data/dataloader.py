class DataLoader(object):
    r"""
    Data loader. Combines a dataset and a sampler, and provides
    single- or multi-process iterators over the dataset.

    Arguments:
        dataset (Dataset): dataset from which to load the data.
        batch_size (int, optional): how many samples per batch to load
            (default: ``1``).
        shuffle (bool, optional): set to ``True`` to have the data reshuffled
            at every epoch (default: ``False``).
        sampler (Sampler, optional): defines the strategy to draw samples from
            the dataset. If specified, ``shuffle`` must be False.
        batch_sampler (Sampler, optional): like sampler, but returns a batch of
            indices at a time. Mutually exclusive with :attr:`batch_size`,
            :attr:`shuffle`, :attr:`sampler`, and :attr:`drop_last`.
        num_workers (int, optional): how many subprocesses to use for data
            loading. 0 means that the data will be loaded in the main process.
            (default: ``0``)
        collate_fn (callable, optional): merges a list of samples to form a mini-batch.
        pin_memory (bool, optional): If ``True``, the data loader will copy tensors
            into CUDA pinned memory before returning them.  If your data elements
            are a custom type, or your ``collate_fn`` returns a batch that is a custom type
            see the example below.
        drop_last (bool, optional): set to ``True`` to drop the last incomplete batch,
            if the dataset size is not divisible by the batch size. If ``False`` and
            the size of dataset is not divisible by the batch size, then the last batch
            will be smaller. (default: ``False``)
        timeout (numeric, optional): if positive, the timeout value for collecting a batch
            from workers. Should always be non-negative. (default: ``0``)
        worker_init_fn (callable, optional): If not ``None``, this will be called on each
            worker subprocess with the worker id (an int in ``[0, num_workers - 1]``) as
            input, after seeding and before data loading. (default: ``None``)

    .. note:: When ``num_workers != 0``, the corresponding worker processes are created each time
              iterator for the DataLoader is obtained (as in when you call
              ``enumerate(dataloader,0)``).
              At this point, the dataset, ``collate_fn`` and ``worker_init_fn`` are passed to each
              worker, where they are used to access and initialize data based on the indices
              queued up from the main process. This means that dataset access together with
              its internal IO, transforms and collation runs in the worker, while any
              shuffle randomization is done in the main process which guides loading by assigning
              indices to load. Workers are shut down once the end of the iteration is reached.

              Since workers rely on Python multiprocessing, worker launch behavior is different
              on Windows compared to Unix. On Unix fork() is used as the default
              muliprocessing start method, so child workers typically can access the dataset and
              Python argument functions directly through the cloned address space. On Windows, another
              interpreter is launched which runs your main script, followed by the internal
              worker function that receives the dataset, collate_fn and other arguments
              through Pickle serialization.

              This separate serialization means that you should take two steps to ensure you
              are compatible with Windows while using workers
              (this also works equally well on Unix):

              - Wrap most of you main script's code within ``if __name__ == '__main__':`` block,
                to make sure it doesn't run again (most likely generating error) when each worker
                process is launched. You can place your dataset and DataLoader instance creation
                logic here, as it doesn't need to be re-executed in workers.
              - Make sure that ``collate_fn``, ``worker_init_fn`` or any custom dataset code
                is declared as a top level def, outside of that ``__main__`` check. This ensures
                they are available in workers as well
                (this is needed since functions are pickled as references only, not bytecode).

              By default, each worker will have its PyTorch seed set to
              ``base_seed + worker_id``, where ``base_seed`` is a long generated
              by main process using its RNG. However, seeds for other libraies
              may be duplicated upon initializing workers (w.g., NumPy), causing
              each worker to return identical random numbers. (See
              :ref:`dataloader-workers-random-seed` section in FAQ.) You may
              use :func:`torch.initial_seed()` to access the PyTorch seed for
              each worker in :attr:`worker_init_fn`, and use it to set other
              seeds before data loading.

    .. warning:: If ``spawn`` start method is used, :attr:`worker_init_fn` cannot be an
                 unpicklable object, e.g., a lambda function.

    The default memory pinning logic only recognizes Tensors and maps and iterables
    containg Tensors.  By default, if the pinning logic sees a batch that is a custom type
    (which will occur if you have a ``collate_fn`` that returns a custom batch type),
    or if each element of your batch is a custom type, the pinning logic will not
    recognize them, and it will return that batch (or those elements)
    without pinning the memory.  To enable memory pinning for custom batch or data types,
    define a ``pin_memory`` method on your custom type(s).

    Example::

        class SimpleCustomBatch:
            def __init__(self, data):
                transposed_data = list(zip(*data))

    #
    # P.S. `worker_result_queue` and `pin_memory_thread` part may be omitted if
    #      `pin_memory=False`.
    #
    #
    # Terminating multiprocessing logic requires very careful design. In
    # particular, we need to make sure that
    #
    #   1. The iterator gracefully exits the workers when its last reference is
    #      gone or it is depleted.
    #
    #      In this case, the workers should be gracefully exited because the
    #      main process may still need to continue to run, and we want cleaning
    #      up code in the workers to be executed (e.g., releasing GPU memory).
    #      Naturally, we implement the shutdown logic in `__del__` of
    #      DataLoaderIterator.
    #
    #      We delay the discussion on the logic in this case until later.
    #
    #   2. The iterator exits the workers when the loader process and/or worker
    #      processes exits normally or with error.
    #
    #      We set all workers and `pin_memory_thread` to have `daemon=True`.
    #
    #      You may ask, why can't we make the workers non-daemonic, and
    #      gracefully exit using the same logic as we have in `__del__` when the
    #      iterator gets deleted (see 1 above)?
    #
    #      First of all, `__del__` is **not** guaranteed to be called when
    #      interpreter exits. Even if it is called, by the time it executes,
    #      many Python core library resources may alreay be freed, and even
    #      simple things like acquiring an internal lock of a queue may hang.
    #      Therefore, in this case, we actually need to prevent `__del__` from
    #      being executed, and rely on the automatic termination of daemonic
    #      children. Thus, we register an `atexit` hook that sets a global flag
    #      `_utils.python_exit_status`. Since `atexit` hooks are executed in the
    #      reverse order of registration, we are guaranteed that this flag is
    #      set before library resources we use are freed. (Hooks freeing those
    #      resources are registered at importing the Python core libraries at
    #      the top of this file.) So in `__del__`, we check if
    #      `_utils.python_exit_status` is set or `None` (freed), and perform
    #      no-op if so.
    #
    #      Another problem with `__del__` is also related to the library cleanup
    #      calls. When a process ends, it shuts the all its daemonic children
    #      down with a SIGTERM (instead of joining them without a timeout).
    #      Simiarly for threads, but by a different mechanism. This fact,
    #      together with a few implementation details of multiprocessing, forces
    #      us to make workers daemonic. All of our problems arise when a
    #      DataLoader is used in a subprocess, and are caused by multiprocessing
    #      code which looks more or less like this:
    #
    #          try:
    #              your_function_using_a_dataloader()
    #          finally:
    #              multiprocessing.util._exit_function()
    #
    #      The joining/termination mentioned above happens inside
    #      `_exit_function()`. Now, if `your_function_using_a_dataloader()`
    #      throws, the stack trace stored in the exception will prevent the
    #      frame which uses `DataLoaderIter` to be freed. If the frame has any
    #      reference to the `DataLoaderIter` (e.g., in a method of the iter),
    #      its  `__del__`, which starts the shutdown procedure, will not be
    #      called. That, in turn, means that workers aren't notified. Attempting
    #      to join in `_exit_function` will then result in a hang.
    #
    #      For context, `_exit_function` is also registered as an `atexit` call.
    #      So it is unclear to me (@ssnl) why this is needed in a finally block.
    #      The code dates back to 2008 and there is no comment on the original
    #      PEP 371 or patch https://bugs.python.org/issue3050 (containing both
    #      the finally block and the `atexit` registration) that explains this.
    #
    #      Another choice is to just shutdown workers with logic in 1 above
    #      whenever we see an error in `next`. This isn't ideal because
    #        a. It prevents users from using try-catch to resume data loading.
    #        b. It doesn't prevent hanging if users have references to the
    #           iterator.
    #
    #   3. All processes exit if any of them die unexpectedly by fatal signals.
    #
    #      As shown above, the workers are set as daemonic children of the main
    #      process. However, automatic cleaning-up of such child processes only
    #      happens if the parent process exits gracefully (e.g., not via fatal
    #      signals like SIGKILL). So we must ensure that each process will exit
    #      even the process that should send/receive data to/from it were
    #      killed, i.e.,
    #
    #        a. A process won't hang when getting from a queue.
    #
    #           Even with carefully designed data dependencies (i.e., a `put()`
    #           always corresponding to a `get()`), hanging on `get()` can still
    #           happen when data in queue is corrupted (e.g., due to
    #           `cancel_join_thread` or unexpected exit).
    #
    #           For child exit, we set a timeout whenever we try to get data
    #           from `data_queue`, and check the workers' status on each timeout
    #           and error.
    #           See `_DataLoaderiter._get_batch()` and
    #           `_DataLoaderiter._try_get_batch()` for details.
    #
    #           Additionally, for child exit on non-Windows platforms, we also
    #           register a SIGCHLD handler (which is supported on Windows) on
    #           the main process, which checks if any of the workers fail in the
    #           (Python) handler. This is more efficient and faster in detecting
    #           worker failures, compared to only using the above mechanism.
    #           See `DataLoader.cpp` and `_utils/signal_handling.py` for details.
    #
    #           For `.get()` calls where the sender(s) is not the workers, we
    #           guard them with timeouts, and check the status of the sender
    #           when timeout happens:
    #             + in the workers, the `_utils.worker.ManagerWatchdog` class
    #               checks the status of the main process.
    #             + if `pin_memory=True`, when getting from `pin_memory_thread`,
    #               check `pin_memory_thread` status periodically until `.get()`
    #               returns or see that `pin_memory_thread` died.
    #
    #        b. A process won't hang when putting into a queue;
    #
    #           We use `mp.Queue` which has a separate background thread to put
    #           objects from an unbounded buffer array. The background thread is
    #           daemonic and usually automatically joined when the process
    #           exits.
    #
    #           However, in case that the receiver has ended abruptly while
    #           reading from the pipe, the join will hang forever. Therefore,
    #           for both `worker_result_queue` (worker -> main process/pin_memory_thread)
    #           and each `index_queue` (main process -> worker), we use
    #           `q.cancel_join_thread()` in sender process before any `q.put` to
    #           prevent this automatic join.
    #
    #           Moreover, having all queues called `cancel_join_thread` makes
    #           implementing graceful shutdown logic in `__del__` much easier.
    #           It won't need to get from any queue, which would also need to be
    #           guarded by periodic status checks.
    #
    #           Note that this may leave corrupted data in the queue, but we
    #           don't care about the data anyways once we are shutting down.
    #
    #
    # Now let's get back to 1:
    #   how we gracefully exit the workers when the last reference to the
    #   iterator is gone.
    #
    # To achieve this, we implement the following logic along with the design
    # choices mentioned above:
    #
    # [worker processes]
    #   While loader process is alive:
    #     Get from index_queue.
    #       If got a `None`, exit.
    #       If get anything else,
    #          Check `done_event`.
    #            If set, continue to next iteration
    #                    i.e., keep getting until see the `None`, then exit.
    #            Otherwise, process data.
    #       If timed out,
    #          No matter `done_event` is set (still need to see `None`) or not,
    #          must continue to next iteration .
    #
    # [pin_memory_thread]
    #   # No need to check main thread. If this thread is alive, the main loader
    #   # thread must be alive, because this thread is set as daemonic.

    #              any time after they receive `None`.

    #     b. Exit `pin_memory_thread`
    #          i.   Put `None` in `worker_result_queue`.
    #          ii.  Join the `pin_memory_thread`.

    #     c. Exit the workers.
    #          i.   Put `None` in each worker's `index_queue`.
    #          ii.  Join the workers.
    #
    #        NOTE: This has to be after (b) because it may leave corrupted data
    #              in `worker_result_queue`, which `pin_memory_thread` reads
    #              from.

    #     processing indices already in `index_queue` if we are already shutting
