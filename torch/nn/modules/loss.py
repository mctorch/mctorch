@weak_module
class NLLLoss(_WeightedLoss):
    r"""The negative log likelihood loss. It is useful to train a classification
    problem with `C` classes.

    If provided, the optional argument :attr:`weight` should be a 1D Tensor assigning
    weight to each of the classes. This is particularly useful when you have an
    unbalanced training set.

    The `input` given through a forward call is expected to contain
    log-probabilities of each class. `input` has to be a Tensor of size either
    :math:`(minibatch, C)` or :math:`(minibatch, C, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)`
    with :math:`K \geq 1` for the `K`-dimensional case (described later).

    Obtaining log-probabilities in a neural network is easily achieved by
    adding a  `LogSoftmax`  layer in the last layer of your network.
    You may use `CrossEntropyLoss` instead, if you prefer not to add an extra
    layer.

    The `target` that this loss expects should be a class index in the range :math:`[0, C-1]`
    where `C = number of classes`; if `ignore_index` is specified, this loss also accepts
    this class index (this index may not necessarily be in the class range).

    The unreduced (i.e. with :attr:`reduction` set to ``'none'``) loss can be described as:

    .. math::
        \ell(x, y) = L = \{l_1,\dots,l_N\}^\top, \quad
        l_n = - w_{y_n} x_{n,y_n}, \quad
        w_{c} = \text{weight}[c] \cdot \mathbb{1}\{c \not= \text{ignore\_index}\},

    where :math:`N` is the batch size. If :attr:`reduction` is not ``'none'``
    (default ``'mean'``), then

    .. math::
        \ell(x, y) = \begin{cases}
            \sum_{n=1}^N \frac{1}{\sum_{n=1}^N w_{y_n}} l_n, &
            \text{if reduction} = \text{'mean';}\\
            \sum_{n=1}^N l_n,  &
            \text{if reduction} = \text{'sum'.}
        \end{cases}

    Can also be used for higher dimension inputs, such as 2D images, by providing
    an input of size :math:`(minibatch, C, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)` with :math:`K \geq 1`,
    where :math:`K` is the number of dimensions, and a target of appropriate shape
    (see below). In the case of images, it computes NLL loss per-pixel.

    Args:
        weight (Tensor, optional): a manual rescaling weight given to each
            class. If given, it has to be a Tensor of size `C`. Otherwise, it is
            treated as if having all ones.
        size_average (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default,
            the losses are averaged over each loss element in the batch. Note that for
            some losses, there are multiple elements per sample. If the field :attr:`size_average`
            is set to ``False``, the losses are instead summed for each minibatch. Ignored
            when reduce is ``False``. Default: ``True``
        ignore_index (int, optional): Specifies a target value that is ignored
            and does not contribute to the input gradient. When
            :attr:`size_average` is ``True``, the loss is averaged over
            non-ignored targets.
        reduce (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default, the
            losses are averaged or summed over observations for each minibatch depending
            on :attr:`size_average`. When :attr:`reduce` is ``False``, returns a loss per
            batch element instead and ignores :attr:`size_average`. Default: ``True``
        reduction (string, optional): Specifies the reduction to apply to the output:
            ``'none'`` | ``'mean'`` | ``'sum'``. ``'none'``: no reduction will be applied,
            ``'mean'``: the sum of the output will be divided by the number of
            elements in the output, ``'sum'``: the output will be summed. Note: :attr:`size_average`
            and :attr:`reduce` are in the process of being deprecated, and in the meantime,
            specifying either of those two args will override :attr:`reduction`. Default: ``'mean'``

    Shape:
        - Input: :math:`(N, C)` where `C = number of classes`, or
          :math:`(N, C, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)` with :math:`K \geq 1`
          in the case of `K`-dimensional loss.
        - Target: :math:`(N)` where each value is :math:`0 \leq \text{targets}[i] \leq C-1`, or
          :math:`(N, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)` with :math:`K \geq 1` in the case of
          K-dimensional loss.
        - Output: scalar.
          If :attr:`reduction` is ``'none'``, then the same size as the target: :math:`(N)`, or

    r"""The `Kullback-Leibler divergence`_ Loss

    KL divergence is a useful distance measure for continuous distributions
    and is often useful when performing direct regression over the space of
    (discretely sampled) continuous output distributions.

    As with :class:`~torch.nn.NLLLoss`, the `input` given is expected to contain
    *log-probabilities* and is not restricted to a 2D Tensor.
    The targets are given as *probabilities* (i.e. without taking the logarithm).

    This criterion expects a `target` `Tensor` of the same size as the
    `input` `Tensor`.

    The unreduced (i.e. with :attr:`reduction` set to ``'none'``) loss can be described as:

    .. math::
        l(x,y) = L = \{ l_1,\dots,l_N \}, \quad
        l_n = y_n \cdot \left( \log y_n - x_n \right)

    where the index :math:`N` spans all dimensions of ``input`` and :math:`L` has the same
    shape as ``input``. If :attr:`reduction` is not ``'none'`` (default ``'mean'``), then:

    .. math::
        \ell(x, y) = \begin{cases}
            \operatorname{mean}(L), & \text{if reduction} = \text{'mean';} \\
            \operatorname{sum}(L),  & \text{if reduction} = \text{'sum'.}
        \end{cases}

    In default :attr:`reduction` mode ``'mean'``, the losses are averaged for each minibatch over observations
    **as well as** over dimensions. ``'batchmean'`` mode gives the correct KL divergence where losses
    are averaged over batch dimension only. ``'mean'`` mode's behavior will be changed to the same as
    ``'batchmean'`` in the next major release.

    followed by a `BCELoss` as, by combining the operations into one layer,
    we take advantage of the log-sum-exp trick for numerical stability.

    This is used for measuring the error of a reconstruction in for example
    an auto-encoder. Note that the targets `t[i]` should be numbers
    between 0 and 1.

    It's possible to trade off recall and precision by adding weights to positive examples.
    In the case of multi-label classification the loss can be described as:

    .. math::
        \ell_c(x, y) = L_c = \{l_{1,c},\dots,l_{N,c}\}^\top, \quad
        l_{n,c} = - w_{n,c} \left[ p_c y_{n,c} \cdot \log \sigma(x_{n,c})
        + (1 - y_{n,c}) \cdot \log (1 - \sigma(x_{n,c})) \right],

    where :math:`c` is the class number (:math:`c > 1` for multi-label binary classification,
    :math:`c = 1` for single-label binary classification),
    :math:`n` is the number of the sample in the batch and
    :math:`p_c` is the weight of the positive answer for the class :math:`c`.

    :math:`p_c > 1` increases the recall, :math:`p_c < 1` increases the precision.

    For example, if a dataset contains 100 positive and 300 negative examples of a single class,
    then `pos_weight` for the class should be equal to :math:`\frac{300}{100}=3`.
    The loss would act as if the dataset contains :math:`3\times 100=300` positive examples.

    Examples::

        >>> target = torch.ones([10, 64], dtype=torch.float32)  # 64 classes, batch size = 10
        >>> output = torch.full([10, 64], 0.999)  # A prediction (logit)

    If provided, the optional argument :attr:`weight` should be a 1D `Tensor`
    assigning weight to each of the classes.
    This is particularly useful when you have an unbalanced training set.

    The `input` is expected to contain raw, unnormalized scores for each class.

    `input` has to be a Tensor of size either :math:`(minibatch, C)` or
    :math:`(minibatch, C, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)`
    with :math:`K \geq 1` for the `K`-dimensional case (described later).

    This criterion expects a class index in the range :math:`[0, C-1]` as the
    `target` for each value of a 1D tensor of size `minibatch`; if `ignore_index`
    is specified, this criterion also accepts this class index (this index may not
    necessarily be in the class range).

    The loss can be described as:

    .. math::
        \text{loss}(x, class) = -\log\left(\frac{\exp(x[class])}{\sum_j \exp(x[j])}\right)
                       = -x[class] + \log\left(\sum_j \exp(x[j])\right)

    or in the case of the :attr:`weight` argument being specified:

    .. math::
        \text{loss}(x, class) = weight[class] \left(-x[class] + \log\left(\sum_j \exp(x[j])\right)\right)

    The losses are averaged across observations for each minibatch.

    Can also be used for higher dimension inputs, such as 2D images, by providing
    an input of size :math:`(minibatch, C, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)` with :math:`K \geq 1`,
    where :math:`K` is the number of dimensions, and a target of appropriate shape
    (see below).


    Args:
        weight (Tensor, optional): a manual rescaling weight given to each class.
            If given, has to be a Tensor of size `C`
        size_average (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default,
            the losses are averaged over each loss element in the batch. Note that for
            some losses, there are multiple elements per sample. If the field :attr:`size_average`
            is set to ``False``, the losses are instead summed for each minibatch. Ignored
            when reduce is ``False``. Default: ``True``
        ignore_index (int, optional): Specifies a target value that is ignored
            and does not contribute to the input gradient. When :attr:`size_average` is
            ``True``, the loss is averaged over non-ignored targets.
        reduce (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default, the
            losses are averaged or summed over observations for each minibatch depending
            on :attr:`size_average`. When :attr:`reduce` is ``False``, returns a loss per
            batch element instead and ignores :attr:`size_average`. Default: ``True``
        reduction (string, optional): Specifies the reduction to apply to the output:
            ``'none'`` | ``'mean'`` | ``'sum'``. ``'none'``: no reduction will be applied,
            ``'mean'``: the sum of the output will be divided by the number of
            elements in the output, ``'sum'``: the output will be summed. Note: :attr:`size_average`
            and :attr:`reduce` are in the process of being deprecated, and in the meantime,
            specifying either of those two args will override :attr:`reduction`. Default: ``'mean'``

    Shape:
        - Input: :math:`(N, C)` where `C = number of classes`, or
          :math:`(N, C, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)` with :math:`K \geq 1`
          in the case of `K`-dimensional loss.
        - Target: :math:`(N)` where each value is :math:`0 \leq \text{targets}[i] \leq C-1`, or
          :math:`(N, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)` with :math:`K \geq 1` in the case of
          K-dimensional loss.
        - Output: scalar.
          If :attr:`reduction` is ``'none'``, then the same size as the target:
          :math:`(N)`, or
          :math:`(N, d_1, d_2, ..., d_K)` with :math:`K \geq 1` in the case

            | :math:`N = \text{batch size}`
            | :math:`C = \text{number of classes (including blank)}`

            The logarithmized probabilities of the outputs
            (e.g. obtained with :func:`torch.nn.functional.log_softmax`).
        **targets**: Tensor of size :math:`(N, S)` or :math:`(\text{sum(target_lengths)})`
            | :math:`N = \text{batch size}`
            | :math:`S = \text{max target length, if shape is } (N, S)`.

            | Target sequences. Each element in the target sequence is a class index. Target index
              cannot be blank (default=0).

            | In the :math:`(N, S)` form, targets are padded to the length of the longest sequence, and stacked.
            | In the :math:`(\text{sum(target_lengths)})` form, the targets are assumed to be un-padded and concatenated
              within 1 dimension.
        **input_lengths**: Tuple or tensor of size :math:`(N)`.
            Lengths of the inputs (must each be :math:`\leq T`).
            Lengths are specified for each sequence to achieve masking under the
            assumption that sequences are padded to equal lengths.
        **target_lengths**: Tuple or tensor of size  :math:`(N)`.
            | Lengths of the targets. Lengths are specified for each sequence to achieve masking under the
              assumption that sequences are padded to equal lengths.

            | If target shape is :math:`(N,S)`, target_lengths are effectively the stop index
              :math:`s_n` for each target sequence, such that ``target_n = targets[n,0:s_n]`` for
              each target in a batch. Lengths must each be :math:`\leq S`

            | If the targets are given as a 1d tensor that is the concatenation of individual targets,
              the target_lengths must add up to the total length of the tensor.

    Example::

        >>> T = 50      # Input sequence length
        >>> C = 20      # Number of classes (excluding blank)
        >>> N = 16      # Batch size
        >>> S = 30      # Target sequence length of longest target in batch
        >>> S_min = 10  # Minimum target length, for demonstration purposes
        >>>
        >>> # Initialize random batch of input vectors, for *size = (T,N,C)
        >>> input = torch.randn(T, N, C).log_softmax(2).detach().requires_grad_()
        >>>
        >>> # Initialize random batch of targets (0 = blank, 1:C+1 = classes)
        >>> target = torch.randint(low=1, high=C+1, size=(N, S), dtype=torch.long)
        >>>
        >>> input_lengths = torch.full(size=(N,), fill_value=T, dtype=torch.long)
        >>> target_lengths = torch.randint(low=S_min, high=S, size=(N,), dtype=torch.long)
        >>> ctc_loss = nn.CTCLoss()
        >>> loss = ctc_loss(input, target, input_lengths, target_lengths)
        >>> loss.backward()

    .. Note::
        In order to use CuDNN, the following must be satisfied: :attr:`targets` must be
        in concatenated format, all :attr:`input_lengths` must be `T`.  :math:`blank=0`,
        :attr:`target_lengths` :math:`\leq 256`, the integer arguments must be of
        dtype :attr:`torch.int32`.

        The regular implementation uses the (more common in PyTorch) `torch.long` dtype.
