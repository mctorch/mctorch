class Conv1d(_ConvNd):
    r"""Applies a 1D convolution over an input signal composed of several input
    planes.

    In the simplest case, the output value of the layer with input size
    :math:`(N, C_{\text{in}}, L)` and output :math:`(N, C_{\text{out}}, L_{\text{out}})` can be
    precisely described as:

    .. math::
        \text{out}(N_i, C_{\text{out}_j}) = \text{bias}(C_{\text{out}_j}) +
        \sum_{k = 0}^{C_{in} - 1} \text{weight}(C_{\text{out}_j}, k)
        \star \text{input}(N_i, k)

    where :math:`\star` is the valid `cross-correlation`_ operator,
    :math:`N` is a batch size, :math:`C` denotes a number of channels,
    :math:`L` is a length of signal sequence.

    * :attr:`stride` controls the stride for the cross-correlation, a single
      number or a one-element tuple.

    * :attr:`padding` controls the amount of implicit zero-paddings on both sides
      for :attr:`padding` number of points.

    * :attr:`dilation` controls the spacing between the kernel points; also
      known as the Ã  trous algorithm. It is harder to describe, but this `link`_
      has a nice visualization of what :attr:`dilation` does.

    * :attr:`groups` controls the connections between inputs and outputs.
      :attr:`in_channels` and :attr:`out_channels` must both be divisible by
      :attr:`groups`. For example,

        * At groups=1, all inputs are convolved to all outputs.
        * At groups=2, the operation becomes equivalent to having two conv
          layers side by side, each seeing half the input channels,
          and producing half the output channels, and both subsequently
          concatenated.
        * At groups= :attr:`in_channels`, each input channel is convolved with
          its own set of filters,
          of size
          :math:`\left\lfloor\frac{out\_channels}{in\_channels}\right\rfloor`.

    .. note::

        Depending of the size of your kernel, several (of the last)
        columns of the input might be lost, because it is a valid
        `cross-correlation`_, and not a full `cross-correlation`_.
        It is up to the user to add proper padding.

    .. note::

        When `groups == in_channels` and `out_channels == K * in_channels`,
        where `K` is a positive integer, this operation is also termed in
        literature as depthwise convolution.

        In other words, for an input of size :math:`(N, C_{in}, L_{in})`,
        a depthwise convolution with a depthwise multiplier `K`, can be constructed by arguments
        :math:`(C_\text{in}=C_{in}, C_\text{out}=C_{in} \times K, ..., \text{groups}=C_{in})`.

          the second `int` for the height dimension and the third `int` for the width dimension

    .. note::

         Depending of the size of your kernel, several (of the last)
         columns of the input might be lost, because it is a valid `cross-correlation`_,
         and not a full `cross-correlation`_.
         It is up to the user to add proper padding.

        When `groups == in_channels` and `out_channels == K * in_channels`,
        where `K` is a positive integer, this operation is also termed in
        literature as depthwise convolution.

        In other words, for an input of size :math:`(N, C_{in}, D_{in}, H_{in}, W_{in})`,
        a depthwise convolution with a depthwise multiplier `K`, can be constructed by arguments
        :math:`(in\_channels=C_{in}, out\_channels=C_{in} \times K, ..., groups=C_{in})`.

class ConvTranspose1d(_ConvTransposeMixin, _ConvNd):
    r"""Applies a 1D transposed convolution operator over an input image
    composed of several input planes.

    This module can be seen as the gradient of Conv1d with respect to its input.
    It is also known as a fractionally-strided convolution or
    a deconvolution (although it is not an actual deconvolution operation).

    * :attr:`stride` controls the stride for the cross-correlation.

    * :attr:`padding` controls the amount of implicit zero-paddings on both
      sides for ``dilation * (kernel_size - 1) - padding`` number of points. See note
      below for details.

    * :attr:`output_padding` controls the additional size added to one side
      of the output shape. See note below for details.

    * :attr:`dilation` controls the spacing between the kernel points; also known as the Ã  trous algorithm.
      It is harder to describe, but this `link`_ has a nice visualization of what :attr:`dilation` does.

    * :attr:`groups` controls the connections between inputs and outputs.
      :attr:`in_channels` and :attr:`out_channels` must both be divisible by
      :attr:`groups`. For example,

        * At groups=1, all inputs are convolved to all outputs.
        * At groups=2, the operation becomes equivalent to having two conv
          layers side by side, each seeing half the input channels,
          and producing half the output channels, and both subsequently
          concatenated.
        * At groups= :attr:`in_channels`, each input channel is convolved with
          its own set of filters (of size
          :math:`\left\lfloor\frac{out\_channels}{in\_channels}\right\rfloor`).

    .. note::

         Depending of the size of your kernel, several (of the last)
         columns of the input might be lost, because it is a valid `cross-correlation`_,
         and not a full `cross-correlation`_.
         It is up to the user to add proper padding.

    .. note::
        The :attr:`padding` argument effectively adds ``dilation * (kernel_size - 1) - padding``
        amount of zero padding to both sizes of the input. This is set so that
        when a :class:`~torch.nn.Conv1d` and a :class:`~torch.nn.ConvTranspose1d`
        are initialized with same parameters, they are inverses of each other in
        regard to the input and output shapes. However, when ``stride > 1``,
        :class:`~torch.nn.Conv1d` maps multiple input shapes to the same output
        shape. :attr:`output_padding` is provided to resolve this ambiguity by
        effectively increasing the calculated output shape on one side. Note
        that :attr:`output_padding` is only used to find output shape, but does
        not actually add zero-padding to output.

@weak_module
class ConvTranspose3d(_ConvTransposeMixin, _ConvNd):
    r"""Applies a 3D transposed convolution operator over an input image composed of several input
    planes.
    The transposed convolution operator multiplies each input value element-wise by a learnable kernel,
    and sums over the outputs from all input feature planes.

    This module can be seen as the gradient of Conv3d with respect to its input.
    It is also known as a fractionally-strided convolution or
    a deconvolution (although it is not an actual deconvolution operation).

    * :attr:`stride` controls the stride for the cross-correlation.

    * :attr:`padding` controls the amount of implicit zero-paddings on both
      sides for ``dilation * (kernel_size - 1) - padding`` number of points. See note
      below for details.

    * :attr:`output_padding` controls the additional size added to one side
      of the output shape. See note below for details.

    * :attr:`dilation` controls the spacing between the kernel points; also known as the Ã  trous algorithm.
      It is harder to describe, but this `link`_ has a nice visualization of what :attr:`dilation` does.

    * :attr:`groups` controls the connections between inputs and outputs.
      :attr:`in_channels` and :attr:`out_channels` must both be divisible by
      :attr:`groups`. For example,

        * At groups=1, all inputs are convolved to all outputs.
        * At groups=2, the operation becomes equivalent to having two conv
          layers side by side, each seeing half the input channels,
          and producing half the output channels, and both subsequently
          concatenated.
        * At groups= :attr:`in_channels`, each input channel is convolved with
          its own set of filters (of size
          :math:`\left\lfloor\frac{out\_channels}{in\_channels}\right\rfloor`).

    The parameters :attr:`kernel_size`, :attr:`stride`, :attr:`padding`, :attr:`output_padding`
    can either be:

        - a single ``int`` -- in which case the same value is used for the depth, height and width dimensions
        - a ``tuple`` of three ints -- in which case, the first `int` is used for the depth dimension,
          the second `int` for the height dimension and the third `int` for the width dimension

    .. note::

         Depending of the size of your kernel, several (of the last)
         columns of the input might be lost, because it is a valid `cross-correlation`_,
         and not a full `cross-correlation`_.
         It is up to the user to add proper padding.

    .. note::
        The :attr:`padding` argument effectively adds ``dilation * (kernel_size - 1) - padding``
        amount of zero padding to both sizes of the input. This is set so that
        when a :class:`~torch.nn.Conv3d` and a :class:`~torch.nn.ConvTranspose3d`
        are initialized with same parameters, they are inverses of each other in
        regard to the input and output shapes. However, when ``stride > 1``,
        :class:`~torch.nn.Conv3d` maps multiple input shapes to the same output
        shape. :attr:`output_padding` is provided to resolve this ambiguity by
        effectively increasing the calculated output shape on one side. Note
        that :attr:`output_padding` is only used to find output shape, but does
        not actually add zero-padding to output.
