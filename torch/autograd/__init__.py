``torch.autograd`` provides classes and functions implementing automatic
differentiation of arbitrary scalar valued functions. It requires minimal
changes to the existing code - you only need to declare :class:`Tensor` s

    The graph is differentiated using the chain rule. If any of ``tensors``
    are non-scalar (i.e. their data has more than one element) and require
    gradient, then the Jacobian-vector product would be computed, in this
    case the function additionally requires specifying ``grad_tensors``.
    It should be a sequence of matching length, that contains the "vector"
    in the Jacobian-vector product, usually the gradient of the differentiated
    function w.r.t. corresponding tensors (``None`` is an acceptable value for
    all tensors that don't need gradient tensors).

    This function accumulates gradients in the leaves - you might need to zero
    them before calling it.

    Arguments:
        tensors (sequence of Tensor): Tensors of which the derivative will be
            computed.
        grad_tensors (sequence of (Tensor or None)): The "vector" in the Jacobian-vector
            product, usually gradients w.r.t. each element of corresponding tensors.
            None values can be specified for scalar Tensors or ones that don't require
            grad. If a None value would be acceptable for all grad_tensors, then this
            argument is optional.
        retain_graph (bool, optional): If ``False``, the graph used to compute the grad
            will be freed. Note that in nearly all cases setting this option to ``True``
            is not needed and often can be worked around in a much more efficient
            way. Defaults to the value of ``create_graph``.
        create_graph (bool, optional): If ``True``, graph of the derivative will
            be constructed, allowing to compute higher order derivative products.

# This function applies in case of gradient checkpointing for memory
# optimization. Currently, for gradient checkpointing, we only support imperative
# backwards call i.e. torch.autograd.backward() and the torch.autograd.grad() won't
# work. The reason being that: torch.autograd.grad() only calculates the grads
# for the inputs that are passed by user but it doesn't calculate grad for
# anything else e.g. model parameters like weights, bias etc. However, for
# torch.autograd.backward(), we would actually compute the grad for the weights as well.
#
# This function returns whether the checkpointing is valid i.e. torch.autograd.backward
# or not i.e. torch.autograd.grad. The implementation works by maintaining a thread
# local variable in torch/csrc/autograd/engine.cpp which looks at the FunctionTask
# in the stack and before a FunctionTask is executed in evaluate_function, it
# checks for whether reentrant backwards is imperative or not.
