# This file contains a list of disabled configurations.  Disabled
# configurations are skipped and not considered a failure if they
# fail.  You can use this to temporarily reserve a test name to
# turn on CI side before PyTorch repository supports it.  This
# file has the same format as .jenkins/enabled-configs.txt
