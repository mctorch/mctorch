# FIXME: Remove the hardcoded "-pthread" option.
# With asan build, the cmake thread CMAKE_HAVE_LIBC_CREATE[1] checking will
# succeed because "pthread_create" is in libasan.so. However, libasan doesn't
# have the full pthread implementation. Other advanced pthread functions doesn't
# exist in libasan.so[2]. If we need some pthread advanced functions, we still
# need to link the pthread library.
# This issue is already fixed in cmake 3.13[3]. If we use the newer cmake, we
# could remove this hardcoded option.
