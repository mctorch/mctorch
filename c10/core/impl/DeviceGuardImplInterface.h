 * DeviceGuardImplInterface represents the virtual interface which provides
 * functionality to provide an RAII class for device and stream switching,
 * via DeviceGuard.  Every distinct device type, e.g., CUDA and HIP, is
 * expected to implement and register an implementation of this interface.
 * All classes which inherit from DeviceGuardImplInterface should be declared
 * 'final'.
 *
 * This class exists because we provide a unified interface for performing
 * device guards via DeviceGuard, but we cannot assume that we have actually
 * compiled against the, e.g., CUDA library, which actually implements
 * this guard functionality.  In this case, a dynamic dispatch is required
 * to cross the library boundary.
 *
 * If possible, you should directly use implementations of this interface;
 * those uses will be devirtualized.
