# Fast RNN benchmarks

Benchmarks for TorchScript models 

For most stable results, do the following:
- Set CPU Governor to performance mode (as opposed to energy save)
- Turn off turbo for all CPUs (assuming Intel CPUs)
- Shield cpus via `cset shield` when running benchmarks.

Some of these scripts accept command line args but most of them do not because
I was lazy. They will probably be added sometime in the future, but the default
sizes are pretty reasonable.

## Test fastrnns (fwd + bwd) correctness

Test the fastrnns benchmarking scripts with the following:
`python -m fastrnns.test`
or run the test independently:
`python -m fastrnns.test --rnns jit`

## Run benchmarks

`python -m fastrnns.bench`

should give a good comparision, or you can specify the type of model to run

`python -m fastrnns.bench --rnns cudnn aten jit --group rnns` 

## Run model profiling, calls nvprof

`python -m fastrnns.profile`

should generate nvprof file for all models somewhere.
you can also specify the models to generate nvprof files separately:

`python -m fastrnns.profile --rnns aten jit` 

### Caveats

Use Linux for the most accurate timing. A lot of these tests only run
on CUDA.
